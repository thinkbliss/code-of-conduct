                        <p>
                        "Material non-public information" about a company is information that a reasonable shareholder would consider important in making a decision to buy or sell stock. Examples include yet-to-be-announced financial or company performance information, mergers or acquisitions, supplier or customer relationships, changes in senior executive management and new products.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="article-sub-heading">What is insider trading?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Insider trading occurs when an individual with knowledge of material non-public information about a company uses it to gain profits or avoid losses in the stock market. You may have access to "inside" information about our company or other companies such as VMware, SecureWorks, current or potential suppliers, customers or acquisition targets. You are obligated to keep this information confidential and you, your family members and individuals with whom you have a personal relationship must never use this kind of information to trade in any company's securities including VMware and SecureWorks. Likewise, you must never provide stock tips or share inside information with any other person who might use it to trade stock. Even if you don't intend for someone to act on the information, sharing it would violate your confidentiality obligations to Dell Technologies and could result in accusations of insider trading against you or Dell Technologies. There are serious legal penalties for insider trading and tipping, including civil liabilities and criminal sanctions (such as a possible jail sentence).

                        Dell Technologies is committed to winning business only on the merits and integrity of its products and solutions. We do not tolerate bribery or corruption, regardless of where we are located or where we do business.  Bribery and corruption are forbidden with respect to both public and private entities, both by this Code and Dell Technologies policies and standards but also, in some countries, by law.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Never provide or accept anything of value that could be perceived as a bribe.  Regardless of local practices or competitive intensity, you must avoid all activity which could constitute bribery or corruption or could give the appearance of bribery or corruption.  This is particularly the case with employees and officials of governments, state-owned or controlled entities, political parties, and international organizations.  Although you must pay particular attention when dealing with public entities and their employees, many anticorruption laws - and this Code and Dell Technologies policies and standards - cover private entities and employees as well.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Complex rules govern the giving of gifts, hospitality and other business courtesies to government officials and employees of governmental or quasi-governmental entities. What may be permissible for commercial customers may be illegal when dealing with the government. All payments, disbursements, rebates, marketing development funds, discounts, credits or other exchanges of currency to a customer or third party must be for legitimate business purposes.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        You must fully comply with the anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we do business, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) as Dell Technologies is based in the United States.  These laws apply to the actions of our company, our team members and third parties who work on our behalf anywhere in the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Any questions related to the above should be directed to the Legal Department.

The customer also told me that, in exchange for securing the internship, the customer will ensure a pending deal with Dell Technologies is executed. Is this a bribe?</li>
                          <li><span class="initial-cap">A</span> : Yes.  A bribe is anything of value, including job opportunities, when offered for an improper purpose, such as an attempt to secure a business transaction.</li>

                          <li><span class="initial-cap">Q</span> : What is the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?</li>
                          <li><span class="initial-cap">A</span> : The FCPA is a U.S. federal law that makes it a crime for companies like Dell Technologies to bribe foreign government officials.  It is the most widely-enforced anti-bribery law and Dell Technologies, and you, must abide by the FCPA since Dell Technologies is a U.S. based company.  You must also abide by the anticorruption laws of every country in which Dell Technologies conducts business.</li>

                          <li><span class="initial-cap">Q</span> :  In support of a government opportunity, a partner is requesting a discount that is above and beyond what is customary for the given product and market.  Is this concerning?</li>
                          <li><span class="initial-cap">A</span> : Yes.  Excess margin, especially in connection with a public deal, is a red flag as it may be a means for creating a slush fund-a side account maintained for unlawful purposes, such as paying a bribe.  You must take extra precautionary measures in this scenario and consult with Finance or Global Ethics & Compliance.</li>

                        We all know that theft is taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission. It can include physically taking something like money or property, or it can be done through other means like forgery, embezzlement or fraud. Fraud is a type of theft by deception. It is making someone believe (by words or conduct or by concealing important information) something that isn't true, with the intent of having them take (or refrain from taking) some action that results in them suffering economic harm.

                        Anyone who engages in or assists others with theft or fraud in connection with their roles at Dell Technologies will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination and will also be subject to prosecution. Help safeguard Dell Technologies' assets and reputation by watching for any kind of fraudulent activities against Dell Technologies, our team members, customers, shareholders, business partners or other stakeholders and report suspicious activity immediately.

                        Money laundering is the process by which funds generated from criminal activity such as drug trafficking are moved through legitimate businesses in order to hide their criminal origin. Terrorist financing refers to funding for terrorist activities and can come from legitimate or criminal sources. You must never knowingly facilitate either money laundering or terrorist financing, and must take steps to prevent inadvertent use of Dell Technologies' business activities for these purposes.  You must be vigilant and exercise good judgment when dealing with customers or business partners. Know who they are, what kind of business they are in, and where their funds come from. Immediately report any unusual or suspicious activities or transactions such as attempted payment in cash or from an unusual financing source, arrangements that involve the transfer of funds to or from countries or entities not related to the transaction or customer, unusually complex deals that don't reflect a real business purpose or attempts to evade record-keeping or reporting requirements.
