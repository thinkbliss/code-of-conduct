                        Reasonable gifts, hospitality and other business courtesies may be appropriate to foster goodwill but should never be used to influence your or a customer's business decision or undermine the integrity of our business relationships.

                            Although nominal gifts and business courtesies (but never cash or cash equivalents) are acceptable under certain limited circumstances, you must never solicit or accept tangible or intangible personal benefits of any kind that are given-expressly or implied-in exchange for securing Dell Technologies business or providing favorable business terms, or that might create or give the appearance of creating a sense of obligation on your or Dell Technologies' part with regard to the giver. We never accept gifts or hospitality that are illegal, immoral or would reflect negatively on Dell Technologies.

                        <p>
                            Gifts may only be given as appropriate business courtesies to enhance relationships and never to inappropriately influence business decisions.  When appropriate to give gifts, you should only offer gifts and hospitality to partners, customers or other third parties for legitimate business purposes and when the gift, hospitality or business courtesy is reasonable in amount, in good taste and in accordance with Dell Technologies' Global Gifts and Hospitality Policy.  Gifts, hospitality and business courtesies may never be in the form of cash or cash equivalents and may only be given to those individuals who are permitted to accept the gift under the laws and policies applicable to them.  More restrictive rules often apply when giving gifts to certain types of customers, like officials or employees of governmental or quasi-governmental entities which can include certain healthcare, utility or education customers.  Always follow the most restrictive rules applicable and reach out to local legal when in doubt.
