                                    <p>Our Code of Conduct, "How We Win," provides guidance on how to carry out our daily activities across Dell Technologies in accordance with our culture and values, as well as in compliance with the letter and spirit of all applicable laws. Our Code applies to all of us. Everyone must adhere to the Dell Technologies' Code, and the policies and standards which flow from our Code. This includes officers, directors and employees of Dell Technologies and their subsidiaries (unless the subsidiary has a separate and distinct Code of Conduct). Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, in accordance with local law. We also expect our contingent workers, agents and all others acting on behalf of Dell Technologies to hold themselves to equally high standards.</p>

                                    <p>Our Code sets one consistent global standard. While we respect cultural differences, if a local custom or business practice violates our Code, we must follow the Code. At the same time, if something permitted or required by our Code violates local law, we must follow local law. Ultimately, we all adhere to one global standard: we win with integrity!

You must also take affirmative steps to influence your team members to do the same. This requires a vocal and visible commitment to integrity. You must not only adhere to the law, our Code, policies and standards, but you also must promote adherence and ethical behavior among your team members. This means you must: </p>

                                    <p><span class="text-weight-medium">Set the right tone.</span> Be comfortable talking with your team members about the importance of acting legally and ethically.
