                            Consistent with local laws, Dell Technologies may collect personal information about team members to meet legal requirements or enable effective business operations.  If your role requires that you have access to team member personal information, make sure you take steps to properly secure it, and that you access or use it only when authorized by Dell Technologies for legitimate business needs and in accordance with applicable laws and Dell Technologies policies. Regardless of your role, if you gain access to a team member's personal information or other private data, always take care to keep it secure.  Never share it with anyone—inside or outside of Dell Technologies-without the team member's permission except as necessary to meet legal or legitimate business requirements. If this information comes to you inadvertently and/or is not required as a part of your role, it is expected that you will inform Human Resources immediately.
