                        <p> Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information is a tremendously valuable asset that differentiates us from our competitors and is protected by law and key agreements.  Some of this information is also considered protectable trade secrets under the law.  Everyone is responsible for the protection of Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information and trade secrets.  Misusing or disclosing information that Dell Technologies considers confidential or proprietary or a trade secret, whether during or after employment, is prohibited and is a violation of the Code of Conduct and your agreements.  In certain circumstances, it may also be a violation of law. Inappropriate disclosure may also result in serious consequences to you and Dell Technologies.  Before you disclose or distribute any confidential information, senior management approval must be obtained and the appropriate terms of use established. This often requires the execution of a written confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement, which restricts the use, disclosure or distribution of the information.</p>

                        <h3 class="article-sub-heading">What is Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information?</h3>
                        <p>Dell Technologies confidential information is any information that is not publically available and may have a level of sensitivity requiring increased levels of protection, management or disposition. Confidential information may include (but is not limited to) nonpublic information about our company, our products, our finances, personal information about our employees, and third party information that has been entrusted to us to protect and is denoted by the Dell Technologies data classification standard.</p>

                        <h3 class="article-sub-heading">What does safeguarding confidential information mean?</h3>
                        <p>Both during your employment and thereafter, you are prohibited from using Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information for your own benefit or disclosing such information to anyone outside of Dell Technologies, without express authorization, unless permitted to do so by the Technology Resources and Information Governance Policy.  Any disclosure under this policy must be in strict adherence to the requirements and protections set forth in that policy.</p>

                        <p>All Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information must be returned when you terminate employment with Dell Technologies. Any taking, downloading, disseminating or other prohibited use or disclosure of Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information could constitute theft of Dell Technologies property.  If such Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information is deemed a trade secret, additional laws may apply.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, you must take steps to prevent inadvertent disclosure of Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information. All security rules must be followed.  In addition, you should not discuss any non-public or confidential or proprietary information about Dell Technologies with outsiders, including family and friends, and should not discuss such information in any public place, such as an elevator, restaurant or airplane. Even within Dell Technologies, information should be shared with others only on a "need to know" basis. For example, broadcast emails containing Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information should be avoided.  You should not post any Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information when using social media tools such as blogs, internet chat boards or social networking sites without prior express authorization. When away from Dell Technologies premises, special care should be taken to protect Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information, in both tangible and electronic form, to prevent inadvertent disclosure in public places.</p>

                        <p>You are likely to meet, talk to or attend functions with individuals who work for Dell Technologies competitors, partners, suppliers or customers. When you come into contact with such individuals, even where the interaction seems innocent, you must be cautious about what you say.  You should never discuss Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information with competitors and must be careful to only discuss Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information with customers, partners or suppliers in adherence to the Technology Resources and Information Governance Policy and with a fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Dell Technologies and the other party. In some cases Dell Technologies has special policies or procedures in connection with its business relationships that require heightened attention to the safeguarding of Dell Technologies confidential and proprietary information.</p>

                        <p>You should also report any attempts by outsiders to obtain Dell Technologies confidential or proprietary information by contacting <a href="mailto:cybersecurity@dell.com">cybersecurity@dell.com.</a></p>

                            <li><span class="initial-cap">A</span> : It depends. To protect the confidentiality of Dell Technologies' strategic business plans and ensure we can comply with all applicable legal requirements, Dell Technologies places tight controls around our acquisition projects. Only certain essential team members are informed of a potential acquisition and they are subject to strict nondisclosure obligations. Unless you know your manager or co-worker is already part of the team working on that project, you should check with the project manager before talking to your manager about it.</li>

                        <p>Dell Technologies competes vigorously, but fairly. We protect Dell Technologies' intellectual property, trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information, and we respect the rights of others to do the same. You may use publicly available information about Dell Technologies competitors or other companies, but may not unlawfully acquire or misuse the trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information of any third party. </p>

                        <p>Dell Technologies prohibits the use of any means, such as cash payments, favors or hiring a competitor's employees, to acquire confidential or proprietary information of third parties. Even if you receive information about another company through legitimate means, you need to determine if the information is confidential or proprietary and how such information may be used. For example, check written documents for labels that designate them as private or confidential. Before using confidential information, approval from the Legal Department must be obtained and you must establish the appropriate terms for its use. This may require the execution of a written confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement, which restricts the use, disclosure or distribution of the information. </p>

                        <p>Once you have received confidential information through legitimate means, you should use, copy, disclose, modify and/or distribute it only in accordance with the terms of any relevant confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement. You must also abide by the lawful obligations you have to your former employer(s).

You must avoid offensive, inflammatory or aggressive language when communicating in connection with your role at Dell Technologies, as well as anything that would embarrass or disparage Dell Technologies. Be truthful and accurate. Do not send emails to people who do not have a legitimate need to receive them. </p>

                        <p>Unless explicitly authorized to speak on behalf of Dell Technologies, you must make it clear that your personal views are yours alone and do not reflect Dell Technologies' views or represent an official company position.

It's simply not enough to do "less bad." We see technology as the key to unlocking regenerative solutions-ones that put more back into society, the environment and the global economy than they take out. Help us uphold this commitment by incorporating sustainable thinking into every aspect of what you do. This means working to design products that utilize energy more efficiently, are made from more preferable materials or are easier to safely recycle and recover materials from at the end of their useful life. It also means streamlining our operations to minimize resource use. </p>
