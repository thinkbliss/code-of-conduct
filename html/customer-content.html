                        <p>Be especially careful when interacting with competitors in connection with benchmarking, industry associations, standards setting bodies or while attending seminars or conventions. To avoid even the appearance of an agreement, avoid discussing with competitors such things as prices, terms of sale, territories, customers, bids, volumes, costs, profits, market share, salaries, hiring practices, distribution methods, relationships with suppliers or non-public information about product or services.</p>

                        <p>Competition laws are complex. Always consult with your manager and the Legal Department before entering into any discussions with competitors, customers, resellers or suppliers about agreements or arrangements, whether in writing, oral or implied, that could have the effect of limiting competition or that could be perceived as having such an effect.</p>
